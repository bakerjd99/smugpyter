![](todo.png) `SmugPyter` TODO
==============================

Pending and considered changes for `SmugPyter` and its subclasses. 
Browse the revision history of this file to review changes. The
base 36 GUID key is stable over the lifetime of a task. Eventually
I will hack together a GIT utility that will troll over the previous
versions of this file and extract all GUID marked tasks.
