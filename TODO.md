![](todo.png) `SmugPyter` TODO
==============================

Pending and considered changes for `SmugPyter` and its subclasses. 
Browse the revision history of this file to review changes. The
base 36 GUID key is stable over the lifetime of a task. Eventually
I will hack together a GIT utility that will troll over the previous
versions of this file and extract all GUID marked tasks. 

`[begin-todo]`

1. `<_0x26cr3mxdgkvqxwtuwo7clpz_>` Add simple gallery metadata function that captures things like the full
    gallery name, last update, number of images and any descriptive text.

2. `<_85xwcz8j2awjeqt1y9qp1f8ev_>` Remove unused functions and improve comments in remaining.

3. `<_c8y9ygpu1wjjcgv00x8t0zy9p_>` Replace double authorization with only one - requires reworking many request functions.

4. `<_5gpgxtf3jkznkpep3378auq72_>` Continue adding to test case files.

5. `<_4euc4ml01fnr2l6nr6hqe0aog_>` Add `SmugPyter` specific exception class - requires many tweaks.

6. `<_e6x7m9kqbms7cpsh73j09qrxz_>` Refine OAuth material in first Jupyter notebook.

7. `<_0sxnv5m9dslqxewh5mvbv9swk_>` Add a notebook illustrating the use of the final working Python scripts.

8. `<_3g6dzam8v2whg7oflf1d8f5ik_>` Fix typos in notebooks and standardize headers, sub-headers, et cetera.

9. `<_d3x4qhey3pan4abgke6oh7qky_>` Spawn related project to build `LaTeX` from `SmugMirror` metadata.
    The long term goal is a book format index of fully captioned images.

10. `<_7frn0f0ak1oq84a6mxwv9lv2c_>` Add simple logging - a few sample images trigger failures. I suspect these files have 
    EXIF, bit depth, or other correctable issues.
