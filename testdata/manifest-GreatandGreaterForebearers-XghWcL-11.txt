Albert is one of my great-great-grandfathers. He is with &#8220;aunt May, (the lady in the black dress), and cousin Marcie and her daughter.&#8221; I am not sure about the spelling of &#8220;Marcie.&#8221; My grandmother Hazel had terrible handwriting in her old age but I have to give her credit for leaving notes on the backs of photographs she considered important. Albert looks at least seventy years old here so I am estimating this picture was taken around 1910.

Burdick 1831-1864 is the oldest family picture I have found so far. Augustus Burdick was the grandfather of my grandmother Helen, making him one of my great-great-grandfathers. Augustus was killed in 1864 during the US Civil War. I actually know a little about Augustus because of Leone Johns, one of Helen&#8217;s nieces, compiled a brief family genealogy. In this document, Leone quoted a letter from the U.S. Dept. of the Interior, National Park Service, Shiloh National Military Park, and Shiloh Tennessee.  &#8220;Augustus A. Burdick, age 31, Residence Decorah, Iowa, Mustered in service March 26, 1863, Commissioned 1st Lieutenant February 25, 1864, killed at Tupelo, Mississippi, July 14, 1864, buried in Corinth Mississippi National Cemetery.   Lieutenant Burdick&#8217;s death is described by regimental commander, Col. Joseph Woods in volume 39, series I of War of the Rebellion: Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, War Dept., Washington, 1892.  Lieutenant A. A. Burdick, acting regimental quartermaster, who was killed, had been ordered to the rear with his train; but after seeing his wagon properly parked, he came to the front and volunteered to assist in bringing forward ammunition. While thus engaged he was struck by a shell and instantly killed.&#8221;

This summer I started going through my maternal grandmother Helen&#8217;s pictures and papers. Helen wasn&#8217;t an exuberant photographer like Hazel. Hazel was always trying to capture candid, sometimes goofy, pictures of people. Helen was more restrained and dignified. Helen would have abhorred the selfie whoring so common today. Restraint is often dull but Helen compensated with superior organization and documentation. Most of her pictures are clearly labeled and dated with some serious exceptions and we are looking at one. In one of her old boxes labeled &#8220;Grandparents&#8221; I found four portraits. All four were modern copies of originals. It looks like they were pictures of pictures. Two pictures were labeled &#8220;Augustus A. Burdick&#8221; and &#8220;Julia Ann Weber Rock&#8221; Augustus and Julia were two of Helen&#8217;s grandparents so I presume the other two pictures were her other grandparents: Eliza Jane Gilbert and Norman Nelson Rock. I am very confident the woman in this picture is Eliza as I have another picture of her sitting with her son, Tilly, and Leone. Eliza was a civil war widow. Her husband was killed when she was twenty-four. I am not sure if she ever remarried. Eliza looks about forty in this picture implying it was taken around 1880.

I found this old mounted portrait in my Grandmother Helen&#8217;s papers. The back of the picture listed the people as &#8220;Dad, Grandma, Tilly, and Leone.&#8221; The man is Gilbert Nelson Burdick, 1858-1935. Gilbert was Helen&#8217;s father and one of my great-grandfathers. The young woman in the back must be Tilly. I have no idea who Tilly was. The older woman in black must be Eliza Jane Gilbert 1840-1915. Eliza was the wife of Augustus A. Burdick. At first, I thought this was unlikely as she does not look old enough but then I checked Eliza&#8217;s birth date: she was twenty-four when Augustus was killed. Augustus was nine years older. Eliza died in 1915 so this was taken a few years before her death. She must be in her seventies here. The child in the picture, Leone, was born in 1910. She looks about four years old here so this portrait was made around 1914. Leone latter composed a brief family history that I have been using to disambiguate these old pictures. Thank you, Leone.

Quoting from Leone Johns&#8217; genealogy, &#8220;She was born in Darmstadt, Germany in 1829 and died in Glendive Montana on April 3, 1906. She came to Derby in 1854 where she married Norma Nelson Rock. She came to Glendive in 1882 with her daughter, Mary, and son, Joseph.&#8221; There is no date on the photograph I have which is a copy of the original, but I would guess Julia was around sixty-five when this photograph was taken giving an approximate date of 1894.

Bert was one of my great grandfathers making Lydia a great-great-grandmother. Albert and Lydia were about the same age and he was born in 1838. I would estimate Lydia is about thirty in this picture implying it was ""made"" around 1870. I say ""made"" because I am not entirely sure this image is a photograph. It looks like a detailed drawing. If that is the case it is a more remarkable image than an old photograph as whoever created the original was an excellent artist."

This image derives from my original Kodachrome slide. The paintings were pictures of a married couple. Margo told me who they were but it didn&#8217;t make much of an impression. I was young and the young seldom give a crap about their great-great-yada-yada ancestors. Margo, Helen, and the original paintings are now long gone and I cannot remember who this man is and anyone that might know is probably in a cemetery. I believe he is one of Margo and Helen&#8217;s grandfathers. Making him one of my great-great-grandfathers. Thanks to an old family genealogy put together by Leone Johns if my guess is correct we are looking at Norman Nelson Rock (1832-1902). The Rocks were on my grandmother&#8217;s maternal line. The paternal line leads to Augustus Alvord Burdick (1831-1864) but Augustus was killed in the US Civil War in his thirties. The man in this painting is certainly older than that!

Mary died before I was born so I never met this great-grandmother. I have only one small print of Mary. I extracted it from a bedside picture frame that Helen kept. Quoting from Leone Johns&#8217; brief family history, &#8220;Mary was born in Derby, Vt. on February 18, 1861 and died on January 20, 1945 in Livingston, Montana. She came to Glendive in 1882 and married Gilbert Nelson Burdick on August 13, 1884 and bore eight children; Earl Vincent (Ted), Jennie Ann, Mary Agnes (Dolly), Francis, Charles Gilbert (Sonny), Geneva, Julia (Margot) and Helen. She also raised three grandchildren; Leone and Georgia Johns and Alice Burdick. She was a very strong woman and controlled the money and property of the family.&#8221; You know how woman frequently complain that modern men are whiny pussy boys compared to the burly men of yore. Well the same holds for woman. Mary was clearly badass by modern standards and woman to the core.

William was one of my great grandfathers. The book noted William&#8217;s parents, Elias Baker and Sarah E. Smith and the date of William&#8217;s marriage to Mary Maier, November 12, 1896. With this information, I was able to extend this branch of the family tree back to the 18th century. Also, included in the book was a Glendive Montana newspaper obituary that summarized Williams&#8217;s life. &#8220;He was born April 15, 1873, at Ireland Ohio and went to Billings in 1888. He began work for the Northern Pacific at the Glen Ulen coal dock in 1894, was made brakeman in 1900 and became a conductor in 1904, a position he held until his retirement in January 1950. Since 1915 he has lived in Glendive.&#8221; William was 78 when he died; he enjoyed less than two years of retirement.

William died before I was born so I never met this great-grandfather. I recently asked my own father if he remembered anything about William. He recalled that Bill, as he called him, worked as a conductor for the Northern Pacific railroad until he was well into his seventies. He didn&#8217;t seem to recall much else which surprised me; my dad was well into his teens when William died. I don&#8217;t know how my grandfather Frank and William got along. They both worked for the same railroad company so I presume William helped my grandfather get his first job. There is no date on the original print but William looks at least seventy in this picture so it must have been taken in late 1940s.
