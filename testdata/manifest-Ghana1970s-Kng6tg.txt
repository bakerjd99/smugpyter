ThumbsPlus Pro does one thing for me that none of my other image processors do. It reliably decodes 16 bit JPEG 2000 files as 16 bit TIF files. Lightroom will not touch 16 bit JPEG 2000 files: a huge intentional slight in my opinion. Picture Window Pro will decode JPEG 2000 files but the resulting TIFs have 8 bits per channel. In my early scanning days I saved the results of all my raw scans as lossless 16 bit JPEG 2000 files because this was, and still is, the smallest lossless 16 bit channel format. Even with JPEG 2000 compression many of my scan files exceed 100 MB. Whenever I upgrade I rummage through my old scans and decode a few just to make sure my extensive image archives are still readable. This is a picture I snapped of some of my Ghana Secondary School students harvesting corn way back in 1976. My students loved having their pictures taken and loved to pose. I should have taken a lot more pictures than I did.

In August of 1975, I started my stint as CUSO volunteer mathematics teacher in Tamale Ghana. New volunteers arrived in Tamale a few weeks before the school term started. We were temporarily housed in a Catholic boarding school about a kilometer from Ghana Secondary School. This was not my first foreign posting. I had lived in southern Iran and Beirut Lebanon as a teenager. I thought I was immune to culture shock. Yet within a few days of arriving in Tamale, I fell into the most peculiar of moods. For about a week I could not read. I had brought a load of math books from Canada to aid my teaching efforts but I could no longer make sense of them. I wondered, in a strange out-of-body way, how I could teach if I couldn&#8217;t read. Eventually, my mood dissipated and my perennial enthusiasms returned. During my reading blackout I set up my camera in the corner of the dorm room I was staying in and shot this self-portrait. Of all my self-portraits, this one came the closest to capturing my feelings at the time.

I&#8217;m including it because one of the houses I lived in was just out of the frame of this shot and, frankly, all these bungalows were the same. This picture was taken from just outside my first house. It had a different floor plan and even had a little courtyard. The courtyard had a papaya tree that produced superb papayas. The papaya tree grew beside the house near a colony of African Bees. The locals were terrified of the bees and for good reason. Entire swarms would occasionally go after people and inflict hundreds of life-threatening stings. The bees protected my papayas from pilfering. Nearby houses had similar papaya trees but the fruit was stolen when the occupants were away.
