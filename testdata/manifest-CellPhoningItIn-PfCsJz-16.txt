It was held in Chesterfield&#8217;s new Central Park. The fair was disappointing: basically restaurants promoting themselves with questionable entr&#233;es. The giant, one of my favorite local sculptures, was surrounded by tents hawking artiste wares. I think the expression on the giant&#8217;s face sums up my feelings.

This weekend I was out walking in Castlewood, one of my favorite parks. I followed the Meramec River trail to its nominal end at a railway underpass that cuts under the tracks and then heads up the bluffs back east. The trail continues west beside the river but there is a prominent No Trespassing sign warning hikers to stay out. For two years I dutifully obeyed but today I asked myself what a lifetime of following the rules has gotten me? Only chumps follow the rules these days. I headed down the trail daring the authorities to track me down. The trail is on railroad land but it quickly rejoins the western portion of Castlewood Park which, to my delight, was almost empty. The slight deterrent of a No Trespassing sign is enough to scare most law abiding chumps. On the way back the sun was shining on the Mississippian dolomite bluffs. I scrambled off the trail and climbed the railway embankment just in time to catch an Amtrak train passing the bluffs.

The tram tops out around 3,400 meters which is as high as lazy earthbound people can go in Montana. There are higher mountains in the state, but sadly they lack trams. The Lone Peak tram differs from other trams I have ridden. The Palm Springs and Albuquerque trams are large multi-tower cars that carry two dozen or more people from their lower to upper stations. At Lone Peak, you first ride a ski lift from 2,300 meters to 2,795 meters. Then you get in a small four-wheel drive truck and ride over to the lower tram station for the final leg up to 3,400 meters. It takes longer than other trams, but you are compensated by the fact that you go higher, and when you reach the top, the glacially sculpted peak yields great 360 degree views.

Most of the year it&#8217;s a small green ball but in early fall it explodes with blossoms. Bees are all over it. The other day I found my favorite plant had been molested by a dog that left a big shit in compressed branches. I also spotted a cigarette butt at the defecation scene. People that let their dogs crap on random lawns piss me off. I was tempted to post a sign &#8211; &#8220;Shit Elsewhere.&#8221; If it happens again I will.

Apparently, university grounds are seething hotbeds of rapists because rape poles are rare off campus. Beside the rape pole stands a sign listing irritating redundant instructions on how to behave in a public park. Biking over people and leaving dog shit around is considered rude! I would have never guessed this on my own. The only useful sign here is the greenbelt map.

The urban core of Boise just barely went for the Hillary in the last election while the rest of the state, especially the north, piled on the Trump train. Much nonsense has been spewed about why most western states, with the exception of Colorado and New Mexico, despise, detest and abhor Democrats in general and Hillary in particular. It all comes down to the unending condescension and contempt westerners have endured for, well forever. It all started with eastern mining interests dictating land and labor policies in the 19th century in places like Butte Montana. For more than a century many key land use policies in the west have been decided by people that don&#8217;t live here. Even today the BLM dominates western land policy. Urban dwellers think this is all fine. Backwoods hicks, smelly cowboys, and obese opioid saturated ""deplorables"" are just not smart enough to make the right decisions on their own! People will put up with all sorts of crap and will even go along with the dictates of demonstrably superior beings but they will resist and resent the condescension of self-appointed betters that are clearly not demonstrably superior beings."

You are looking at the women that designed, using 1960's era drafting tools, the first APL character set. The slight differences between many original Greek characters and APL glyphs can be seen in Jean's original design. It's Jean's work that resulted in what's still the most beautiful programming language character set ever created. It's about time Jean got some some long overdue acclaim.

For the most part, the US is a decaying Hildabeast, Trumpkin, and social justice warrior infested dystopian hellscape but public libraries are bucking the apocalyptic trend. All of these public systems are good to excellent. In the last ten years, I have been favorably impressed by US public libraries all over the country. Even microscopic small towns like Bluffton Indiana have excellent public libraries. In fact, tiny little Bluffton&#8217;s public library was better than any public library in Ottawa Canada which is a national capital and should have but doesn&#8217;t excellent public libraries. Perhaps Hell has superb libraries which begs the question is eternal damnation really all that bad for readers?

I always take a peak, especially in bad weather, because that&#8217;s when you get the interesting shots. This time it was bright and sunny and she ventured forth and immediately expressed approval. &#8220;This is beautiful!&#8221;

The loop also hosts urban art. Here I am sexually assaulting a street statue. The loop is right beside Washington University and like most &#8220;rape culture&#8221; campuses Wash U supports a forest of blue light rape poles. Why anyone sends their daughters to such dangerous environments is beyond me. For the sarcasm impaired: don&#8217;t expect any apologies for the lack of &#8220;trigger warnings.&#8221;

Yellowstone hosts so many marvels that its forest of standing petrified trees is often overlooked. The hike to the forest is short but like so many trails around here all up-hill. As I age, ungracefully I might add, I find climbing more and more of a chore. While I slowly worked my way up the slopes Mali fretted about bears and wolves. The petrified trees are on the hills above the Lamar Valley which have become a favorite area for wolf watching. We didn&#8217;t see any bears or wolves but we went off the trail to avoid a lone Bison that was busy munching grass. You don&#8217;t want to tick them off either.

There are a few small private turquoise mines still operating but few, if any, allow tourists. A few kilometers south of Cerrillos you pass through Madrid. Today some biker event was on and Madrid&#8217;s one tourist-oriented street was packed with old boomer bikers. We drove through Madrid twice looking for &#8220;The Holler&#8221; which, according to TripAdvisor.com, is one of the better Madrid eateries. On our third pass, we found it, and the gods of parking opened a spot right out front. I have to agree with TripAdvisor my biscuit delimited burger was sublime and Mali&#8217;s chicken sandwich was good as well.

The old have no more shits to give and are frankly enjoying their situation.

At this time of year you can spot Bald Eagles from the bridge. We saw a few eagles in the trees and a few more flying above the river banks but they were too far away to get a good look. I was more impressed with the Mississippi. It&#8217;s still up after recent floods. The old bridge is one mile long and the river runs under most of it. The word &#8220;Mississippi&#8221; derives from a native phrase meaning &#8220;gathering of waters&#8221; and, yeah, it&#8217;s a big freaking gathering of waters.

If you&#8217;re foolish enough to believe all the glitzy Apple advertising you might think that 7 pluses made dramatic photographic improvements. It&#8217;s all hype people! I have loaded a range of 7 plus images into my image processors and analyzed the data, not the drivel. The 7 series offers modest improvements in image quality with significant changes in post processing. The high dynamic range images are more aggressively blended which can lead to a hazy look. Low light shots are just over processed: ugh! I will have figure out how to get RAWs out of this creature. Apparently shooting in RAW is now an option on the 7 plus. With RAWs I can apply my own refined and tasteful post processing for worthy images. This will probably force a Lightroom upgrade on me and you know how I feel about Adobe&#8217;s upgrade policies. God, it sucks to be a perfectionist. Bottom line: cell phones still suck compared to proper big boy cameras.

The short hike through the slot canyon and up the overlooking ridge may be one of the best short hikes I&#8217;ve ever taken. This little monument holds the best hoodoos and soft rock erosion features I have seen anywhere. New Mexico geology is not disappointing.

It's the largest and oldest venue of its type in the US and one of the things people in St. Louis can be genuinely proud of."

Idaho, a leading flyover state, populated by roving bands of deplorables, has decided that people should be free to purchase raw milk. Other states opt for strict regulation of this dangerous substance. Beverage choice must be regulated for the common good. It&#8217;s crap like this that led to Trump. Here&#8217;s the correct philosophy: regulation should only be enacted when there is an overwhelming public interest. Otherwise &#8220;freedom&#8221; is a meaningless buzz word.

Of course, that land was stolen from native tribes that spent thousands of years stealing and re-stealing the land from other tribes. The diversity racket has jumped the shark: intersectionality and ten-thousand genders were the final nails in that intellectually frivolous coffin.

Before the play started I snapped a quick iPhone shot of the set. In retrospect it was the best thing about the play. Disgraced is what I call a typical East Coast play. It&#8217;s loaded with shallow New Yorker friendly progressive themes so naturally it&#8217;s been hailed by critics. Disgraced makes the case that Muslims are suffering in our prejudiced western society. This is true but what Disgraced fails to convey is how this is different from the prejudices suffered by others in the past. Your assimilation angst is not unique. Stop whining!

Geography is poorly taught or ignored in US schools. Combine institutional indifference with an incurious populace and you end up with citizens that cannot locate their buttholes without GPS. Given this pathetic situation, I was pleased to find this map outlining the US states on a school playground. It makes you wonder how many grade-schoolers could take a piece of chalk and correctly label all states.
